# Automatic Profile Creation for New Users

## 🎯 THE SOLUTION

You're absolutely right! When users log in with Privy (especially with smart wallets), they don't have a database entry. Now the app will **automatically create a basic profile** when any wallet connects.

## 🔧 What Was Added

### 1. Database Migration
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250126000000_auto_create_profiles.sql`

Two new database functions:

#### `ensure_profile_exists(wallet_address)`
- Automatically creates a basic profile if one doesn't exist
- Uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to avoid duplicates
- Sets a default display name: `0x1234...5678`

#### `create_my_profile(wallet_address)`
- Public-facing function that can be called from frontend
- Creates profile if needed, returns existing profile if found
- Returns profile data as JSON

### 2. React Hook
**File**: `src/hooks/useAutoCreateProfile.ts`

Automatically calls the database function when:
- A wallet address is detected ✅
- Privy is ready ✅
- User is connected ✅

Only runs once per session to avoid duplicate calls.

### 3. Integration
**File**: `src/providers/Web3Provider.tsx`

Added `useAutoCreateProfile()` to the `SessionManager` component, so it runs for every user automatically.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. User Logs In with Privy
```
User logs in → Privy creates smart wallet → Wallet address detected
```

### 2. Auto-Create Profile
```typescript
useAutoCreateProfile() detects wallet address
↓
Calls: supabase.rpc('create_my_profile', { p_wallet_address })
↓
Database function ensures profile exists
↓
Profile ready! ✅
```

### 3. Profile Created
```sql
INSERT INTO profiles (wallet_address, display_name)
VALUES ('0x1234...5678', '0x1234...5678');
```

## 📊 Database Schema

The auto-created profile will have:
```
wallet_address: '0x...' (normalized to lowercase)
display_name: '0x1234...5678' (can be edited later)
created_at: NOW()
updated_at: NOW()
... all other fields NULL/default
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Deploy Migration
```bash
cd supabase
npx supabase migration up
```

Or deploy via Supabase dashboard.

### Step 2: Test Flow
1. **Log out** if currently logged in
2. **Clear browser cache** (or use incognito)
3. **Log in with Privy email** (or any method)
4. **Check console logs** - should see:
   ```
   🔧 Auto-creating profile for: 0x...
   ✅ Profile ensured for wallet: 0x...
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Database
Check Supabase dashboard → `profiles` table → should see new entry with your wallet address.

### Step 4: Test ProfileEdit
1. Go to `/profile-edit`
2. Should NOT see "wallet not connected" error
3. Debug panel should show green checkmarks
4. Can fill out and save profile

## 🔍 Console Output

When it works, you'll see:
```
🔍 Checking Privy wallets: { walletsCount: 1, ... }
✅ Got address from useWallets: 0x...
🔧 Auto-creating profile for: 0x...
✅ Profile ensured for wallet: 0x...
Profile data: { wallet_address: '0x...', display_name: '0x1234...5678', ... }
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### Before:
1. User logs in with Privy ✅
2. Wallet detected ✅
3. Goes to ProfileEdit ❌
4. Error: "Please connect wallet" (profile doesn't exist)
5. User confused 😕

### After:
1. User logs in with Privy ✅
2. Wallet detected ✅
3. **Profile auto-created** ✅
4. Goes to ProfileEdit ✅
5. Everything works! 🎉
