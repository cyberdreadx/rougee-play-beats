# Commit Summary - Netlify Build Fix

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Home Page Navigation Issue** 
Users couldn't access `rougee.app` without manually adding `/trending` or another route.
- **Cause**: Service worker was using "cache first" strategy
- **Fix**: Changed to "network first" strategy + bumped cache version

### 2. **Netlify Build Failures**
Multiple issues causing Netlify builds to fail:
- **Issue A**: Private `lovable-tagger` package couldn't be installed
- **Issue B**: Import statement with `.tsx` extension
- **Issue C**: `require()` in ES module context

### 3. **UI Issues**
- TOP GAINER stat showing `...` when it should show `0%`
