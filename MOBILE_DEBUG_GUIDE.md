# Mobile/PWA Debug Guide for ProfileEdit

## 🎯 Visual Debug Panel Added

Since iOS PWA doesn't have browser console access, I've added a **visual debug panel** that shows wallet connection status directly in the UI.

## 📱 How to Test

### Step 1: Access Debug Panel
1. **Go to ProfileEdit page** on your mobile/PWA
2. **Look for the "Debug" button** in the top-right corner (next to your XRGE balance)
3. **Tap "Debug"** to show the debug panel

### Step 2: Check Debug Info
The debug panel will show:
- **Full Address**: Your wallet address (should be green if working)
- **Privy Connected**: Whether Privy thinks you're connected
- **Privy Ready**: Whether Privy is fully loaded
- **Wagmi Connected**: Whether wagmi can see your wallet
- **Has PrivyWagmi**: Whether the sync hook is working

### Step 3: Try to Save Profile
1. **Fill out the profile form**
2. **Tap "Save Profile"**
3. **If it fails**, the debug panel will automatically show
4. **Check the status** - look for red text indicating problems

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Working (All Green)
```
Full Address: 0x1234...5678 ✓
Privy Connected: true ✓
Privy Ready: true ✓
Wagmi Connected: true ✓
```

### ❌ Problem Cases

**Case 1: No Address**
```
Full Address: undefined ✗
Privy Connected: true ✓
Privy Ready: true ✓
Wagmi Connected: false ✗
```
→ **Issue**: Wallet detection problem

**Case 2: Timing Issue**
```
Full Address: undefined ✗
Privy Connected: true ✓
Privy Ready: true ✓
Wagmi Connected: false ✗
```
→ **Issue**: Privy/wagmi sync timing

**Case 3: Not Connected**
```
Full Address: undefined ✗
Privy Connected: false ✗
Privy Ready: true ✓
Wagmi Connected: false ✗
```
→ **Issue**: Need to reconnect wallet

## 🛠️ Quick Fixes

### If "Full Address" is undefined:
1. **Tap "Refresh Page"** button in debug panel
2. **Reconnect your wallet** if needed
3. **Try saving again**

### If everything looks green but still fails:
1. **Wait 2-3 seconds** and try again
2. **Check if you're on the right network** (Base)
3. **Try refreshing the page**

## 📸 Screenshots to Share

If you're still having issues, please share:
1. **Screenshot of the debug panel** when the error occurs
2. **What the status shows** (which items are red vs green)
3. **When exactly the error happens** (immediately or after delay)

This will help identify the exact problem! 🔧

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/ProfileEdit.tsx` - Added visual debug panel and debug button
- `src/hooks/useWallet.ts` - Enhanced logging (still works for desktop)
- `src/hooks/usePrivyWagmi.ts` - Already had good debugging

The debug panel will automatically appear when there's a wallet connection issue, making it easy to diagnose problems on mobile/PWA! 📱✨
