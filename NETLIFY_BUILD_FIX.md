# Netlify Build Fix

## Problem
Netlify build was failing due to:
1. Missing `lovable-tagger` - a private dependency that Netlify couldn't install
2. Missing build configuration for Netlify
3. No proper SPA routing redirects

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created `netlify.toml`
- Configured build command and publish directory
- Set Node.js version to 20
- Added NPM flags for legacy peer dependencies
- Configured SPA routing redirects (all routes → index.html)
- Added security headers and caching for assets

### 2. Created `.npmrc`
- Enabled legacy peer dependencies
- Marked optional dependencies to skip if unavailable

### 3. Updated `package.json`
- Moved `lovable-tagger` from `devDependencies` to `optionalDependencies`
- This allows npm to skip it if it can't be installed (e.g., private package on Netlify)

### 4. Updated `vite.config.ts`
- Added safe import wrapper for `lovable-tagger`
- Uses try-catch to gracefully handle when the package is missing
- Only uses the tagger in development mode anyway
- Falls back to null if not available (production builds work without it)

### 5. Fixed Service Worker Cache Strategy
- Changed from "cache first" to "network first" for HTML files
- This fixes the home page navigation issue
- Users now get fresh content instead of stale cached versions

### 6. Suppressed Build Warnings
- Suppressed `/*#__PURE__*/` annotation warnings from dependencies
- Suppressed eval warnings from protobufjs
- Increased chunk size warning limit to 5MB

## Files Changed
- ✅ `netlify.toml` (new)
- ✅ `.npmrc` (new)
- ✅ `package.json` (lovable-tagger moved to optionalDependencies)
- ✅ `vite.config.ts` (safe import for lovable-tagger + warning suppression)
- ✅ `public/sw.js` (network-first strategy + cache version bump)
- ✅ `src/pages/Trending.tsx` (fixed "..." display in TOP GAINER stat)

## Testing
Local build tested successfully:
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ built in 26.52s (no errors)
```

## Deployment
After pushing these changes:
1. Commit all the new files
2. Push to your repository
3. Netlify will automatically trigger a new build
4. The build should succeed now

## Next Steps
- Users may need to hard refresh once (Ctrl+F5) to get the updated service worker
- Monitor Netlify build logs to confirm success
