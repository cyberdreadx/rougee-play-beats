# ✅ Play Tracking System IMPLEMENTED!

## 🎯 **Overview**
Users now get **5 free plays per song** before needing to purchase it. After purchase, they get unlimited plays.

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **For Non-Logged-In Users:**
- ✅ **20-second preview** - Same as before
- ✅ **Login prompt** - After preview ends

### **For Logged-In Users:**
- ✅ **5 free plays** - Tracked per song
- ✅ **Play counter** - Shows remaining plays
- ✅ **Ownership check** - Unlimited plays if owned
- ✅ **Purchase prompt** - After 5 plays

### **For Song Owners:**
- ✅ **Unlimited plays** - No restrictions
- ✅ **Ownership indicator** - Shows "Owned" status

## 🗄️ **Database Schema**

### **Tables Created:**
1. **`user_plays`** - Tracks individual plays
2. **`user_song_ownership`** - Tracks ownership

### **Functions Created:**
- `get_user_play_count()` - Get play count for user/song
- `user_owns_song()` - Check if user owns song
- `can_user_play_song()` - Check if user can play (with limits)
- `record_play()` - Record a play
- `grant_song_ownership()` - Grant ownership (for purchases)

## 🎨 **UI Features**

### **Play Status Indicators:**
- **Non-authenticated**: "Preview: 20s remaining" (yellow)
- **Authenticated (free)**: "Free plays: 3/5" (blue)
- **Authenticated (owned)**: "Owned - Unlimited plays" (green)

### **Modals:**
- **Login Prompt** - For non-authenticated users
- **Ownership Prompt** - For users who exceeded play limit

## 🔍 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Database Migration**
```sql
-- Track individual plays
CREATE TABLE user_plays (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_wallet_address TEXT NOT NULL,
  song_id UUID NOT NULL,
  played_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Track ownership
CREATE TABLE user_song_ownership (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_wallet_address TEXT NOT NULL,
  song_id UUID NOT NULL,
  ownership_type TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### **2. React Hook**
```typescript
const { playStatus, recordPlay, checkPlayStatus } = usePlayTracking(songId);
```

### **3. Edge Function**
- **`track-play`** - Records plays and returns updated status
- **JWT validation** - Ensures secure play tracking
- **Rate limiting** - Prevents abuse

### **4. AudioPlayer Integration**
```typescript
// Check play limits
useEffect(() => {
  if (authenticated && isPlaying && playStatus && !playStatus.canPlay) {
    audio.pause();
    setShowOwnershipPrompt(true);
  }
}, [authenticated, isPlaying, playStatus]);

// Record play
useEffect(() => {
  if (authenticated && isPlaying && playStatus?.canPlay) {
    setTimeout(() => recordPlay(songId), 2000);
  }
}, [authenticated, isPlaying, playStatus]);
```

## 🧪 **Test Cases**
