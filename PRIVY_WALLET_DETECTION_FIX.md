# Privy Wallet Detection Fix - CRITICAL

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

The app was NOT detecting Privy wallet addresses because we were looking in the **wrong place**.

### What Was Wrong:
```typescript
// OLD CODE - Only checked user.linkedAccounts
let walletAccount = user?.linkedAccounts?.find(...)
const address = walletAccount?.address;
```

This approach:
- ❌ Only looked at `user.linkedAccounts`
- ❌ Didn't use Privy's proper wallet API
- ❌ Missed embedded wallets on mobile/PWA

## ✅ THE FIX

Now using **Privy's `useWallets` hook** - the proper way to get wallet addresses:

```typescript
// NEW CODE - Uses Privy's official wallet hook
import { useWallets } from '@privy-io/react-auth';

const { wallets } = useWallets();
const address = wallets[0]?.address; // Get first wallet address
```

This approach:
- ✅ Uses Privy's official API
- ✅ Works with embedded wallets
- ✅ Works on mobile/PWA
- ✅ Falls back to linkedAccounts if needed

## 🔍 Enhanced Debug Logging

The new version logs:
1. **useWallets data**: Shows all wallets detected by Privy
2. **linkedAccounts data**: Shows all linked accounts as fallback
3. **Source**: Where the address came from (useWallets or linkedAccounts)
4. **All account details**: Type, address, keys for debugging

## 📱 How to Test

1. **Refresh the page** on your iOS PWA
2. **Check the browser console** (or debug panel)
3. **Look for these logs**:

```
🔍 Checking Privy wallets: { walletsCount: 1, wallets: [...] }
✅ Got address from useWallets: 0x1234...5678
🔍 useWallet FINAL STATE: { address: '0x1234...5678', SOURCE: 'useWallets' }
```

4. **Go to ProfileEdit** and check the debug panel:
   - Full Address should now show your address ✅
   - Wagmi Connected should be true ✅

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### Before:
- Privy was connected ✅
- But address was undefined ❌
- Because we weren't using the right hook

### After:
- Privy is connected ✅
- Address is detected ✅
- Using proper `useWallets` hook

## 📊 Priority Order

The new logic checks in this order:

1. **`useWallets` hook** (Privy's official way)
   - Most reliable
   - Works with embedded wallets
   - Recommended by Privy

2. **`user.linkedAccounts`** (fallback)
   - Only if useWallets fails
   - Still checks all account types
   - Looks for any Ethereum address

## 🔧 Files Changed

- `src/hooks/useWallet.ts` - Now uses `useWallets` hook
- Enhanced logging to show exactly what Privy is returning
- Added comprehensive fallback logic

## 🚀 Expected Result

After this fix, when you log in with Privy on iOS PWA:

1. **useWallets will detect your embedded wallet**
2. **Address will be extracted immediately**
3. **ProfileEdit will work without errors**
4. **Debug panel will show green checkmarks**

This is the **correct** way to integrate Privy wallets according to their documentation!
