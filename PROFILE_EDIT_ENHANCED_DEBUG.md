## 🔍 Debug Console Output

The enhanced logging will show:
```
🔍 usePrivyWagmi: Starting connection process
🔍 Available wallets: [{ type: 'embedded_wallet', address: '0x...' }]
🔍 Available connectors: [{ id: 'privy', name: 'Privy' }]
🎯 Selected connector: { id: 'privy', name: 'Privy' }
🔌 Connecting wallet to wagmi using Privy privy
✅ Wallet connected to wagmi successfully
```

## 🎯 Root Cause

The issue is that Privy's embedded wallet isn't automatically syncing with wagmi on mobile/PWA. The enhanced fixes:

1. **Aggressive connection retry** - tries multiple connectors
2. **Fallback detection** - checks all linked accounts
3. **Manual retry option** - user can force retry
4. **Enhanced logging** - shows exactly what's happening

## 📱 Mobile/PWA Specific

This is a common issue with Privy + wagmi on mobile/PWA because:
- **Timing issues** between Privy and wagmi initialization
- **Connector selection** problems on mobile
- **Address detection** issues with embedded wallets

The enhanced fixes address all these issues with multiple fallback mechanisms.

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/usePrivyWagmi.ts` - Enhanced connection logic with retry
- `src/hooks/useWallet.ts` - Enhanced address detection
- `src/pages/ProfileEdit.tsx` - Added retry button to debug panel

Try the "Retry Connection" button in the debug panel - it should fix the wagmi sync issue! 🔧📱
