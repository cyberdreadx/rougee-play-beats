# ✅ Profile Upload FIXED!

## 🎯 **The Problem**
The profile upload was hanging on "Uploading avatar..." because it was using the **wrong Lighthouse API endpoint**.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
Comparing the working song upload vs broken profile upload:

### ❌ **Profile Upload (BROKEN)**
```typescript
// WRONG ENDPOINT
const uploadResponse = await fetch('https://node.lighthouse.storage/api/v0/add', {
```

### ✅ **Song Upload (WORKING)**  
```typescript
// CORRECT ENDPOINT
const uploadResponse = await fetch('https://upload.lighthouse.storage/api/v0/add', {
```

## 🔧 **The Fix**
Updated the profile upload function to use the **correct Lighthouse API endpoint**:

- **Changed from**: `https://node.lighthouse.storage/api/v0/add`
- **Changed to**: `https://upload.lighthouse.storage/api/v0/add`

## 🚀 **Deployed Successfully**
The fixed edge function is now live at:
`https://phybdsfwycygroebrsdx.supabase.co/functions/v1/update-artist-profile`

## 🧪 **Test It Now!**

**Go back to your app and try saving your profile again!** 

You should now see:
- ✅ **No more hanging on "Uploading avatar..."**
- ✅ **Fast IPFS uploads** (using correct endpoint)
- ✅ **Profile saves successfully**
- ✅ **Avatar and cover photos upload to IPFS**

## 📊 **Expected Logs**
In Supabase logs, you should see:
```
🔄 Uploading avatar... (12345 bytes)
✅ Uploaded avatar to Lighthouse: QmHash...
🔄 Uploading cover photo... (67890 bytes)  
✅ Uploaded cover photo to Lighthouse: QmHash...
🔄 Uploading metadata JSON... (567 chars)
✅ Uploaded JSON metadata to Lighthouse: QmHash...
Profile updated successfully
```

**The profile upload should work perfectly now!** 🎉
