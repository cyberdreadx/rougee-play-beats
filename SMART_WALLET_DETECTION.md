# Smart Wallet Detection Fix

## 🎯 THE ISSUE

You're using **Privy Smart Wallets**, which have a different structure than regular embedded wallets. The app wasn't specifically looking for smart wallet types.

## 🔍 Smart Wallet vs Regular Wallet

### Regular Embedded Wallet:
```javascript
{
  type: 'embedded_wallet',
  walletClientType: 'privy',
  address: '0x...'
}
```

### Smart Wallet:
```javascript
{
  type: 'smart_wallet',
  walletClientType: 'privy',
  connectorType: 'embedded',
  address: '0x...',
  delegated: true
}
```

## ✅ THE FIX

### Priority Order for Wallet Detection:

1. **useWallets Hook** (Privy's official API):
   - First look for `walletClientType === 'privy'`
   - Then look for `connectorType === 'embedded'`
   - Then check for `type === 'smart_wallet'`
   - Fallback to first wallet

2. **user.linkedAccounts** (Fallback):
   - First look for `type === 'smart_wallet'` ⭐
   - Then `type === 'embedded_wallet'`
   - Then `type === 'privy'`
   - Then `type === 'wallet'`
   - Last resort: any account with valid 0x address

### Enhanced Logging:

The code now logs:
```javascript
🔍 Checking Privy wallets: {
  walletsCount: 1,
  wallets: [{
    type: 'privy',
    address: '0x...',
    chainId: 8453,
    connectorType: 'embedded',
    imported: false,
    delegated: true  // ← Smart wallet indicator
  }]
}
```

## 📱 How to Test

1. **Refresh your iOS PWA**
2. **Check the console logs** - you should see:
   ```
   🔍 Checking Privy wallets: { walletsCount: 1, wallets: [...] }
   ✅ Got address from useWallets: 0x... Type: privy
   🔍 useWallet FINAL STATE: { address: '0x...', SOURCE: 'useWallets' }
   ```

3. **Go to ProfileEdit** and click **Debug**
4. **Full Address should now show** your smart wallet address ✅

## 🚨 Why Smart Wallets Were Missing

### Before:
- Code only looked for generic wallet types
- Didn't prioritize `smart_wallet` type
- Didn't check `connectorType` or `delegated` properties

### After:
- Explicitly looks for smart wallet indicators
- Checks multiple smart wallet properties
- Prioritizes smart wallet over other wallet types
- Enhanced logging shows ALL wallet properties

## 🔧 What Changed

**File**: `src/hooks/useWallet.ts`

### 1. Enhanced useWallets Detection:
```typescript
// Look for smart wallet specifically
const smartWallet = wallets.find(w => 
  w.walletClientType === 'privy' || 
  w.connectorType === 'embedded' ||
  (w as any).type === 'smart_wallet'
);

const primaryWallet = smartWallet || wallets[0];
```

### 2. Enhanced linkedAccounts Detection:
```typescript
// PRIORITY: Look for smart_wallet type FIRST
let walletAccount = user.linkedAccounts.find((account: any) =>
  account.type === 'smart_wallet'
) as any;
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging:
```typescript
console.log('🔍 Checking Privy wallets:', {
  walletsCount: wallets.length,
  wallets: wallets.map(w => ({
    type: w.walletClientType,
    address: w.address,
    chainId: w.chainId,
    connectorType: w.connectorType,  // ← NEW
    imported: w.imported,             // ← NEW
    delegated: w.delegated            // ← NEW (smart wallet indicator)
  }))
});
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

### When logged in with Smart Wallet:
1. **useWallets** detects smart wallet
2. **Address is extracted** immediately
3. **Debug panel shows green checkmarks**
4. **Profile save works**

## 📊 Debug Panel Should Show:

```
Full Address: 0x1234...5678 ✅ (green)
Privy Connected: true ✅ (green)
Privy Ready: true ✅ (green)
Wagmi Connected: true ✅ (green)
Has PrivyWagmi: true ✅ (blue)
```

## 🔍 If Still Not Working

Check the console for:
```
🔍 Checking Privy wallets: { ... }
```

Send me the full output of this log - it will show:
- How many wallets Privy sees
- What type they are
- What properties they have
- Whether they have addresses

This will tell us exactly what Privy is returning for your smart wallet! 🔧

## 🚀 Next Step: Auto-Create Profiles

Once we confirm the address detection works, we need to add **automatic profile creation** for new users so they don't see the "wallet not connected" error on first login.
