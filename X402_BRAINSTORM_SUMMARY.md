## 🎯 Key Integration Ideas

### 🎵 **PRIMARY MODEL: Ad-Supported Free + Premium**

**Free Tier**: Unlimited streaming with 15-30 second ads every ~2 minutes

**Premium Access** (Ad-Free):
- **Option A**: Pay $4.99/month via x402 (USDC)
- **Option B**: Hold 1,000+ XRGE tokens (no monthly fee!)

This creates **XRGE utility** while generating revenue from both ads AND subscriptions!

[See detailed implementation: `x402-examples/ad-supported-premium-model.md`]
