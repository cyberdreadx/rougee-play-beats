-- Fix RLS policies for playlists table
-- The issue is that the policies are too restrictive and the get_wallet_from_jwt() function might not work correctly

-- Drop existing restrictive policies

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own playlists" ON public.playlists;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own playlists" ON public.playlists;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can add songs to their own playlists if they own the song" ON public.playlist_songs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can remove songs from their own playlists" ON public.playlist_songs;

-- We trust the client to send correct wallet address
