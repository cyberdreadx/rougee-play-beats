## üé¨ Quick Wins (Ship in Week 1)

If you want to ship something FAST to test the concept:

### Minimal Viable x402 Integration
1. **Add x402 SDK** (2 hours)
2. **Create payment verification endpoint** (4 hours)
3. **Add "Premium" toggle to one test song** (2 hours)
4. **Create simple payment modal** (4 hours)
5. **Test end-to-end with testnet USDC** (4 hours)

**Total**: 16 hours to have a working demo!

### Demo Flow
1. Mark song as premium (0.01 USDC)
2. User clicks play
3. Payment modal appears
4. User pays via x402
5. Song plays
6. Artist sees revenue in dashboard

This proves the concept before committing to full implementation.
