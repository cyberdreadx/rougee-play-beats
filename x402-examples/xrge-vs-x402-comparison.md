## 🔄 Conversion Bridge

### Option A: Manual Swap
Users can swap between XRGE and USDC via DEX integration.

```typescript
// In-app swap component
<SwapWidget
  from="USDC"
  to="XRGE"
  amount={10}
  route={uniswapRoute}
/>
```

**Pros**: User controls timing, tax implications  
**Cons**: Extra step, gas fees  

---

### Option B: Auto-Convert
Platform automatically converts as needed.

```typescript
// User has 0 USDC but 100 XRGE
// Wants to play premium song (0.01 USDC)
if (usdcBalance < songPrice && xrgeBalance > minSwapAmount) {
  // Auto-swap just enough XRGE → USDC
  await swapXRGEtoUSDC(0.01);
  // Then pay for song
  await x402.pay(0.01);
}
```

**Pros**: Seamless UX, no mental overhead  
**Cons**: May trigger at bad price, surprise swaps  

---

### Option C: Dual Balance (Recommended)
Users maintain separate XRGE and USDC balances.

```typescript
// Header displays both balances
<WalletDisplay>
  <Balance>
    💰 XRGE: 1,250
    💵 USDC: 25.50
  </Balance>
  <TopUpButton token="USDC" />
  <TopUpButton token="XRGE" />
</WalletDisplay>
```

**Pros**: Clear separation, user choice  
**Cons**: Users need to manage two balances  

**Recommendation**: Use Option C with optional auto-convert fallback.

## 🎯 Strategic Advantages

### Why Dual-Token is Better Than Single-Token

#### If Only XRGE (No x402)
❌ Price volatility scares casual users  
❌ Complex for non-crypto natives  
❌ Tax implications on every transaction  
❌ Can't attract AI agents (need stablecoin)  
❌ Harder to price premium content  

#### If Only USDC (No XRGE)
❌ No governance mechanism  
❌ No trading/speculation layer  
❌ No way to capture platform value  
❌ Can't reward long-term holders  
❌ Miss out on DeFi liquidity  

#### With Both XRGE + USDC (Optimal)
✅ Stablecoin for consumption (no volatility)  
✅ XRGE for speculation and governance  
✅ USDC fees buy & burn XRGE (deflationary)  
✅ AI agents can use platform (USDC)  
✅ Clear mental model: "Pay USDC, trade XRGE"  
✅ Flexibility for different user types

## 🤔 Open Questions

### 1. Tax Implications
- Do users need to report USDC micropayments?
- How do we handle 1099-K for artists earning USDC?
- Should we partner with crypto tax software?

### 2. Liquidity
- What's the depth of XRGE/USDC pool?
- Should we incentivize liquidity providers?
- Do we need to seed initial liquidity?

### 3. Pricing
- Should x402 prices be dynamic or fixed?
- Do artists set own premium prices?
- Should we A/B test price points?

### 4. User Education
- How do we explain dual-token model?
- Interactive tutorial?
- Separate wallets or unified interface?

---

## ✅ Recommended Implementation

```typescript
// Unified wallet interface
interface RougeWallet {
  xrge: {
    balance: number;
    price: number; // in USDC
    holdings: SongToken[]; // Song tokens user owns
  };
  usdc: {
    balance: number;
    monthlySpent: number;
    earned: number; // For artists
  };
  tier: 'Bronze' | 'Silver' | 'Gold' | 'Platinum';
  discounts: {
    premiumPlays: number; // e.g., 0.20 = 20% off
    apiCalls: number;
  };
}

// Smart payment router
const pay = async (amount: number, token: 'XRGE' | 'USDC') => {
  if (token === 'USDC') {
    // Use x402
    return await x402.pay(amount);
  } else {
    // Use existing XRGE payment
    return await xrgeContract.transfer(recipient, amount);
  }
};
```
